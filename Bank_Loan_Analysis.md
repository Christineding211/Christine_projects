# Bank Loan Data Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

The goal of the Bank Loan Data Analysis is to create a comprehensive report and dashboards that monitor and evaluate the bank's lending activities. This analysis aims to:

1. **Provide actionable insights** into key loan-related metrics, such as total loan applications, funded amounts, payment received statuses, and borrower profiles.
2. **Track performance trends** over time using metrics like Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
3. **Distinguish loan quality** by categorising loans as "Good Loans" (fully paid or current) and "Bad Loans" (charged off) to assess the health of the loan portfolio.
4. **Facilitate data-driven decision-making** by presenting visualisations such as line charts, bar charts, maps, and treemaps to understand trends, loan purposes, borrower profiles, and regional differences.
5. **Evaluate borrower characteristics** like employment length, home ownership, and debt-to-income ratio to uncover patterns.
6. A user-friendly details dashboard allows stakeholders to view all essential metrics and data points in one place.
