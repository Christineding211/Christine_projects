  The average ride time for Customers was 2 hours, substantially higher compared to Subscriber rides which averaged 12 minutes.
  
  B. Subscriber ride lengths remained consistent throughout the week. This suggests potential influences from the subscription model, such as pricing structures favouring shorter trips.
