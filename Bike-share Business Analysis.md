## Business Goal : How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclitic bikes differently?

## Key tasks: 
•	Identify the business task
•	Consider key stakeholders: manager and the marketing executive

## Analyst Process : 
### 1. Compare the average ride length for members and casual riders. 
The average ride length for customers is 1 hour, whereas the subscribers is 13 minutes. 

### 2.	Calculate and compare the average for users by day of week.
  A. Customer ride lengths on Day 5 (Thursday) exhibited a significant deviation from the typical weekly pattern. 
  The average ride time for Customers was 2 hours, substantially higher compared to Subscriber rides which averaged 12 minutes.
  B. Subscriber ride lengths remained consistent throughout the week. This suggests potential influences from the subscription model, such as pricing structures favouring shorter trips. 
  Furthermore, there might be locations or routes that are particularly attractive to non-regular users for sightseeing.
